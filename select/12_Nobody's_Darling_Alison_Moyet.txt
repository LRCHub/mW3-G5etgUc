She laughs aloud outside, shiny as a new moon
But she's staying home tonight and I don't know why
She likes to think aloud, I'm trying hard to hear her
But she's said enough for now and I don't know why

You can sit in my chair, but you're nobody's darling

I had it all with you, was it only yesterday
But I had it all to do, now I've only yesterday

She says if I stay here and if I'm barely moving
When I lose what I hold dear then I won't know why

I had it all with you
