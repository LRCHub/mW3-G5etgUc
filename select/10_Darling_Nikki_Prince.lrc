[00:25.43] I knew a girl named Nikki
[00:27.60] I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
[00:31.83] I met her in a hotel lobby
[00:34.20] Masturbating with a magazine
[00:37.52] She said, "How'd you like to waste some time?"
[00:40.03] And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind
[01:06.03] 
[00:56.24] She took me to her castle
[00:58.74] And I just couldn't believe my eyes
[01:02.51] She had so many devices
[01:04.96] Everything that money could buy
[01:08.28] She said, "Sign your name on the dotted line"
[01:11.76] The lights went out and Nikki started to grind
[01:34.76] 
[01:18.69] Oh, Nikki
[01:23.19] 
[01:27.07] The castle started spinning
[01:29.26] Or maybe it was my brain
[01:31.98] I can't tell you what she did to me
[01:34.44] But my body will never be the same
[01:51.44] 
[01:38.62] Oh, her lovin' will kick your behind
[01:42.72] Oh, she'll show you no mercy
[01:45.08] But she'll sure enough, sure enough
[01:47.57] Show you how to grind
[01:58.07] 
[01:50.54] Darling, Nikki
[01:53.96] Oh
[01:54.96] 
[01:57.55] Woke up the next morning
[02:00.74] Nikki wasn't there
[02:03.50] I looked all over, all I found
[02:06.26] Was a phone number on the stairs
[02:09.11] It said, "Thank you for a funky time
[02:13.37] Call me up whenever you wanna grind"
[02:31.37] 
[02:19.53] Oh, Nikki
[02:24.59] Oh, oh
[02:27.59] 
[02:31.91] Aw, come back Nikki, come back
[02:35.84] Your dirty little Prince wanna grind, grind, grind, grind
