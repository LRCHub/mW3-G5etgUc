Light the paper, wait for the all clear,
Like a fuse I burn for you dear,
Like a flower that yearns for moisture,
My roots are tangled, I ain't got no choice dear.

My Darling,
I'll do anything you want,
Oh I'll do anything it takes,
To make you fall,
Surrender, surrender.

Dead in the city, walking through traffic,
A burned out head on a broken matchstick,
Life's a trial, life's a burden.
Life's a drag and don't deserve it

My Darling,
I'll do anything you want,
Oh I'll do anything it takes,
To make you fall,
Surrender, surrender.

You've got to remember,
I've got a heart condition,
Just listen closer,
Every fourth beat is missing
If it ain't missing then it's skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skipping.
It's good for nothing is it good enough for you?

Oh I'll do anything you want.
Oh I'll do anything it takes
Oh I'll do anything you want.
Oh I'll do anything it takes
